### Creating a box

1. Create a new directory for your Punica project:

```shell
mkdir tutorialtoken
cd tutorialtoken
```
2. Download ("unbox") the tutorialtoken box:

```shell
punica unbox tutorialtoken
```
Note: You can use the Punica unbox <box-name> command to download any of the other Punica Boxes.

Note: To create a bare Punica project with no smart contracts included, use punica init.


Once this operation is completed, you'll now have a project structure with the following items:

- `contracts/`: Directory for Ontology smart contracts.
- `src/`: Directory for DApp source file.
- `test/`: Directory for test files for testing your application and contracts.
- `wallet/`: Directory for save Ontology wallet file.



### Publish your box


To create a Punica Box you'll need a few things:

* A GitHub repository
* A configuration file
* Optionally, small and large images for the box's listing
* Contract us.
