### 1. Installation

Solo-chain is an Ontology single-node private-net. It generates a block every six seconds.

You can view the [source code](https://github.com/punicasuite/solo-chain) in GitHub and download the release version from [here](https://github.com/ontio/ontology/releases).

### 2. Introduction

1. The function of "reboot" is to restart the private-net and clear the existing data. And the function of "stop" is to stop the private-net.
2. The default port of RPC server is 20336. For Restful server, the port is 20334. For websocket server, it is 20335.
3. The height of blockchain will increase by one every six seconds. Gas price can be changed in the setting. Gas limit is a fixed number, 20000.
4. In the account page, we have 5 accounts at first and the ONT and ONG in each account can be transferred. The ONG can be obtained by redeeming ONG.
